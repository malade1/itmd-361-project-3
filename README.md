Fahad Wahid:

I am a great team player! I work well with other people primarily because 
I work in retail. Up until this point, I am great with valid HTML and how
to work well with CSS. I particularly need a little help with the mobile first views.

my strength would be on time and communication about the progress of the project. 
This is my first programming group project, i love to know more about web development.
I know about html and css but i will love to learn more.
